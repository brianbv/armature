Armature
========
Armature is a wireframing extension for Inkscape.  Armature works by grouping visible and hidden layers into sets.  Each set can be used as a view or slide in your wireframes.

An HTML wrapper allows you to view your wireframes in browsers outside of Inkscape.

Installing
---------

To install, copy the contents of the inkscape folder into your Inkscape extensions folder.  On Windows, this folder is typically
C:\[your program files path]\Inkscape\share\extensions.

Using Armature
--------------

Amature is can be found in the Extensions menu. From there you
will be able to create and update layer sets

###Creating and Upating Layer sets###

Armature layer sets are created in the Create/Update Layer Set tab
of the Armature extension.  When you create or update a layer set
the states of each layer in your document  are recorded.

###Deleting Layer sets###

Activate the Armature layer in Inkscape. Delete the text element containing the name of the set you wish to delete.

###Generating Wireframes###

Armature packs your wireframes into a single HTML file that can be used in modern web browers.  You can then pusblish or distribute this file. 
 
###Viewing Wireframes###

Open the generated HTML file in your browser of choice. Use the forward and backward arrow keys to navigate.
